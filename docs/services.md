### `dreame_vacuum.vacuum_clean_segment`

Start selected room cleaning with optional customized cleaning parameters. 
> - If you are using integration with map feature, you can acquire segment ids from vacuum entity attributes.
> - Cleaning parameters and cleaning sequence are ignored by the device when `customized_cleaning` or `cleaning_sequence` is enabled.

**Examples:**

- Clean room 3
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_clean_segment

    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_select_map
    data:

    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_rename_map
    data:
        map_id: 14

Replaced new map will always be at last available index event replaced with a lower indexed map. <a href="https://github.com/Tasshack/dreame-vacuum/blob/master/docs/#multi-floor-map-support" target="_blank">(More about multi-floor map support)</a>

**Example:**

- Replace new map with map with id 39
    ```yaml

    target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum
    ```

### `dreame_vacuum.vacuum_merge_segments`

Merge two rooms from a map.

> - When multi-floor map feature is enabled selected map will change to edited map.

**Examples:**

- Merge rooms 4 with 6 on the map with 63 (Room 6 will be deleted)

> You can acquire line coordinates coordinates with <a href="https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card/blob/master/docs/templates/setup.md#getting-coordinates" target="_blank_">Xiaomi Vacuum Map Card</a>.
> - Line coordinates must cover selected room area.
> - Deleted segment ids are not used again and new segment always will be at highest next available index.
> - When multi-floor map feature is enabled selected map will change to edited map.

**Example:**

- Split room 4 from line coordinates (A new room will be created and room 4 settings will set to defaults)
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_replace_temporary_map
    data:
