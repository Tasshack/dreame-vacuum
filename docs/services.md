### `dreame_vacuum.vacuum_clean_segment`

Start selected room cleaning with optional customized cleaning parameters. 
> - If you are using integration with map feature, you can acquire segment ids from vacuum entity attributes.
> - Cleaning parameters and cleaning sequence are ignored by the device when `customized_cleaning` or `cleaning_sequence` is enabled.

## Map Services
Map editing services also uses the vacuum domain because all services are available even without cloud connection.

<a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_services/" target="_blank"><img src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/developer_services.svg" alt="Open your Home Assistant instance and show your service developer tools." /></a>

### `dreame_vacuum.vacuum_request_map`

Request device to upload a new map to the cloud. *(This service is useful when cloud connection is not used and another integration used for handing the map rendering)*

> Device does not responds to this action when:
> - Spot cleaning
> - Fast mapping
> - Relocating
> - After a map edit until it moves

### `dreame_vacuum.vacuum_select_map`

Change currently selected map. (Only possible of multi-floor map is enabled)

> - You can acquire map id from saved map camera entity attributes.

> - Robot will end active job when selected map is changed.

**Example:**

- Set current map as map with id 27
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_select_map
    data:
        map_id: 27
    target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum
    ```

### `dreame_vacuum.vacuum_delete_map`

Delete a map.

> - You can acquire map id from saved map camera entity attributes.
> - When multi-floor map feature is enabled map indexes may change after deletion. <a href="https://github.com/Tasshack/dreame-vacuum/blob/master/docs/#multi-floor-map-support" target="_blank">(More about multi-floor map support)</a>

**Example:**

- Set delete map with id 48
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_delete_map
    data:
        map_id: 48
    target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum
    ```

### `dreame_vacuum.vacuum_rename_map`

Rename a map.

> - You can acquire map id from saved map camera entity attributes.
> - Official App does not allow you to enter special characters in map name but this integration does so use this service carefully.

**Example:**

- Rename map with id 14 to "Second Floor"
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_rename_map
    data:
        map_id: 14
        map_name: "Second Floor"
    target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum
    ```

### `dreame_vacuum.vacuum_restore_map`

Restore a map from previous state that are created and uploaded by the device.
> - It is not guaranteed that map recovery will be successful. Cloud does not store the files forever and recovery files usually be deleted from the cloud after 365 days from the last access.
>  - Cloud connection is required with this service.

**Examples:**

- Restore selected map to second saved recovery map in the recovery map list
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_restore_map
    data:
        recovery_map_index: 2
    target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum
    ```

- Restore saved map with id 14 to original state
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_restore_map
    data:
        map_id: 14
        recovery_map_index: 1
    target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum
    ```

### `dreame_vacuum.vacuum_restore_map_from_file`

Restore a map from previously saved recovery map file.
> - This service can be used for offline recovery if you download and place the recovery map file to the /www/ folder of Home Assistant (Vacuum and server must be at the same network).
> - Map Id is required if cloud connection is not enabled.

**Examples:**

- Restore selected map from saved recovery map file
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_restore_map_from_file
    data:
        file_url: http://192.168.1.10/local/2023-11-04-1724223415-423528451_284320462.1156.mb.tbz2
    target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum
    ```

    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_restore_map_from_file
    data:
        map_id: 14
        file_url: https://dreame-cn.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/iot/tmp/000000/ali_dreame/YR649291/648921668/101?Expires=1699189998&OSSAccessKeyId=LTAI5t96WkBXXNzQrX4HtQti&Signature=ttRrjg8p7aC650H3DwI3%2F2ngOOE%3D
    target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum
    ```

### `dreame_vacuum.vacuum_backup_map`

Trigger upload of a saved map as a recovery map to the cloud.
> - Cloud can store only one backup map for every saved map. This service will override the previously backup map if you have one.
> - Vacuums without a camera or a lidar sensor does not have this feature, map backup trigger only works on supported devices.

**Examples:**

- Trigger backup of selected map
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_backup_map
    target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum
    ```

- Trigger backup of map with id 15
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_backup_map
    data:
        map_id: 15
    target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum
    ```

### `dreame_vacuum.vacuum_set_restricted_zone`

Set invisible walls, no go and no mopping zones on current map.

> - You can acquire line and zone coordinates with <a href="https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card/blob/master/docs/templates/setup.md#getting-coordinates" target="_blank_">Xiaomi Vacuum Map Card</a>.
> - All object must be passed at one, you cannot add or remove single wall or no zone. You can acquire current line and zone coordinates from selected map camera entity attributes.

**Examples:**

- Define virtual walls, restricted zones, and/or no mop zones
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_set_restricted_zone
    data:
        walls: 
            - - 819
              - -263
              - 4424
              - 2105

### `dreame_vacuum.vacuum_replace_temporary_map`

Replace new map with an old one.

> - You can acquire map id from saved map camera entity attributes.

Replaced new map will always be at last available index event replaced with a lower indexed map. <a href="https://github.com/Tasshack/dreame-vacuum/blob/master/docs/#multi-floor-map-support" target="_blank">(More about multi-floor map support)</a>

**Example:**

- Replace new map with map with id 39
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_replace_temporary_map
    data:
        map_id: 39
    target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum
    ```

### `dreame_vacuum.vacuum_merge_segments`

> - You can acquire map and segment ids from saved map camera entity attributes.
> - Rooms needs to be neighbors with each other.
> - Deleted segment ids are not used again on new created segments.
> - When multi-floor map feature is enabled selected map will change to edited map.

**Examples:**

- Merge rooms 4 with 6 on the map with 63 (Room 6 will be deleted)
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_replace_temporary_map
    data:
        map_id: 63
        segments: 
            - 4
            - 6
    target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum
    ```

- Merge rooms 6 with 4 on the map with 63 (Room 4 will be deleted)
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_replace_temporary_map

> - You can acquire line coordinates coordinates with <a href="https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card/blob/master/docs/templates/setup.md#getting-coordinates" target="_blank_">Xiaomi Vacuum Map Card</a>.
> - Line coordinates must cover selected room area.
> - Deleted segment ids are not used again and new segment always will be at highest next available index.
> - When multi-floor map feature is enabled selected map will change to edited map.

**Example:**

- Split room 4 from line coordinates (A new room will be created and room 4 settings will set to defaults)
    ```yaml
    service: dreame_vacuum.vacuum_replace_temporary_map
    data:
